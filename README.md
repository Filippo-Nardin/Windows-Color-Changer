# Windows-Color-Changer

It is possible to simply run it by double-clicking it. However, it is best used if scheduled to start at the user's login (using Window's Task Scheduler). In this way, after the login, the Light/Dark theme will be chosen accordingly to the time.

## Customization
It is possible to set the range of time in which the Light theme will be chosen over the Dark one by smply editing the day_start and day_end variables.
